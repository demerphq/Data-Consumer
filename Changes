Revision history for Data-Consumer

0.17    Wed Nov 1 2017
        Fix a bug with ignored in MySQL2, thanks to Maksym Davydov

0.16    Fri Jun 24 2016
        The deprecated warning behavior of Data::Consumer::MySQL was
        a major blocker to upgrading Data::Consumer, so it has been
        changed to be opt in. See the docs for Data::Consumer::MySQL.

        Fork Data::Consumer::MySQL into Data::Consumer::MySQL2. There
        were and are subtle issues with the implementation of DC::MySQL.
        As we have a lot of code using it the easiest way is to fork
        the module and fix it in the new version. *Most* old code should
        be unaffected. However if you are processing very quickly, with
        many workers, on a newer MySQL especially, then it is possible
        that two workers might process the same record twice due to a subtle
        race condition in MySQL query plan evaluation. The new version in
        MySQL2 should be robust to this problem.

        Reset the 'fail' flag before processing any new item

0.13    Mon Jul 18 2011
        Fixed bug in leave() implementation: The status for 'unprocessed'
        could previously not be '0'.

0.12    Fri Mar 27 2011
        Note in documentation that an explicit lock_prefix should almost
        always be specified.

0.11    Fri Mar 27 2011
        Fix SELECT GET_LOCK order-of-evaluation issue.
        This is an important bug fix if you're running Data::Consumer in
        a pipeline-fashion with multiple consumers working on items in
        various stages. If in doubt, upgrade.

0.10 
        Lots of changes. Fixed an important bug and disabled the broken sweep
        functionality for now. Also silence some warnings on older perls.

0.09
        Added support for 'leave', 'ignore', 'fail' and 'halt'. They probably
        could be better documented and tested.

0.08
        Pretty close to ready for release. Cleaned up pod and perltidied
        the code (my current parameters of choice are in comments in .pm 
        files). Spent some time on the make process to have configurable
        mysql arguments, which default to off for automated processed.

0.01    2008-02-10
        Initial creation. Support Mysql and File based data resources.
